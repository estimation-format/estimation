# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Renamed to estrec** ("estimation record"; Ted 2026-11-06), a clean break with no aliases
  while 0.1 is a draft: type strings `estrec/0.1`, `estrec-collection/0.1`,
  `estrec-table/0.1` (schema files `schema/estrec-0.1.json` etc.); file suffixes
  `.estrec.json`, `.estrec-collection.json`, `.estrec-table.json`; `$id`s under
  `https://estrec.org/schema/`; the spec is `spec/estrec.md`; the Python package, import and
  command are all `estrec` (was `estimation-format`, `estimation_format`, `estimation`);
  environment variables `ESTREC_SCHEMA_PATH`, `ESTREC_REDACT_SALT`; the viewer's script is
  `viewer/estrec-table.js`; the repository moves to github.com/estrec/estrec. Profile names
  and function names (`to_estimation()`, `write_estimation()`, `read_estimation()`,
  `as_estimation_test()`, the converters) are unchanged. Entries below use the old names.
- estrec.org (`server/`): one Cloudflare Worker serves the home page, the schemas at their
  `$id`s and the viewer, and a Publish service. `POST /api/publish` stores a table spec and
  its records, with identifying fields removed, in R2 and returns an unlisted `/t/<id>` link
  and a delete token. The page is the viewer's web export, rendered by the Worker under a CSP
  that allows only its own script. Tables expire a year after their last view; the licence is
  CC0 1.0 (default), CC BY 4.0 or CC BY-SA 4.0; Turnstile and per-IP limits guard publishing;
  there is a report page. The viewer shows **Publish…** when it is served from the site
  (`viewer/publish.js`). The GitHub Pages workflow is removed.

- Table specs, `estimation-table/0.1` (`spec/table.md`, `schema/estimation-table-0.1.json`,
  catalog entry `table`; proposal `docs/proposals/table-spec.md`, Ted 2026-11-05): a saved
  layout for a regression table from records, with no results in it. Columns name records by
  `meta.id` (with source paths as hints and an optional `sha256` pin) and may pick another
  vcov, a component or a response; rows are ordered and relabelled, with `keep`/`drop`
  patterns and shared rows; statistics rows are metrics, the vcov type or cluster counts,
  fixed effects, tests or literal text. A companion to the format: records and collections
  don't change. Python: `estimation_format.table` (`new_table`, `read_table`, `write_table`,
  `validate_table`, `build_table`, `render`/`render_table` to text, Markdown, LaTeX, HTML
  and CSV, `to_great_table`; `python -m estimation_format.table spec.json -f latex`).
- The record viewer (`viewer/`, published at
  https://estimation-format.github.io/estimation/viewer/): a static page that reads records,
  folders and collections in the browser (nothing is uploaded), shows one record in full, and
  builds a table: columns from records (each with its own vcov), terms shown, ordered and
  relabelled, statistics rows, stars and decimals, with a live journal-style preview and
  LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, CSV, text or table-spec export (optionally pinning record versions).
  Its logic, `viewer/estimation-table.js`, runs in node too; tests check that it builds and
  renders the same tables as the Python reference and agrees with its t distribution.
- estrec `render_table(spec, output, records)`: renders a table spec through modelsummary (each
  column a model from the record's `tidy()` with its vcov; statistics rows by the spec's rules
  as `add_rows`). The example spec gives the same cells as the Python and browser renderers.
- Viewer: tables that link to their records. In the preview, a column heading shows a summary
  of its record on hover and opens it on click. A new **Web page** export writes one
  self-contained HTML file with the table and the records behind it: hover a heading for a
  summary (estimator, N, standard errors, fixed effects, software), click it for the full
  record (estimates, metrics, variance estimates, fixed effects, tests, the JSON and a
  download). Identifying fields are left out by default (`viewer/identifying.js`, generated
  from the schemas' `x-identifying` marks; the same result as the Python `redact`). Built
  tables carry `column_records`, the record behind each column (Python and JS).
- Table specs: several lines under each estimate (Ted, 2026-11-05). `uncertainty` may be a
  list of names and templates, one row each (`["std_error", "[{p_value}]"]`, `"p = {p_value}"`,
  `"[{conf_low}, {conf_high}]"`; placeholders `{estimate}`, `{std_error}`, `{statistic}`,
  `{p_value}`, `{conf_low}`, `{conf_high}`). `format.p_digits` sets p-value decimals and
  `format.p_style` shows small ones as `0.000` (`"fixed"`) or `<0.001` (`"less_than"`), in
  these lines and in test p-value rows. Python, the viewer (a line editor) and estrec
  `render_table()` agree cell for cell; existing specs render as before.
- CLI: `estimation show` (the quick look) and `estimation table` (render or `--check` a table
  spec); `estimation validate` also takes table specs. `ef.show` and `ef.table` are available
  from `import estimation_format as ef`.
- estrec reads records: `read_estimation()` (a record, or a folder of them) and
  `read_collection()` (embedded members or a members file) return records of class
  `estimation_record`, kept as written. `print` gives a quick view; `tidy` and `glance`
  methods, registered on generics, let modelsummary and other broom-based table packages take
  records as they take fitted models. `tidy(vcov = "iid")` and other vcovs in the record
  recompute SEs, tests and intervals; `component =` selects first-stage and other components.
  The writers accept records read back in.
- estrec and Python `glance` give the metrics a regression table shows by default (N, R2s,
  AIC, BIC, log-likelihood, F, RMSE as sqrt(rss / nobs)); `metrics = "all"` gives every one.
  estrec's feols records now carry `aic` and `bic`, as its GLM records did. A modelsummary
  table from records matches the one from the fits (tested when broom is installed).
- A quick look in the terminal (`estimation_format.show`, `python -m estimation_format.show`):
  a detail view of one record (estimates, metrics, FE level counts, vcov and its ssc, tests,
  messages), or a side-by-side table of several records, a folder or a collection.
  `--vcov`, `--digits`, `--table`/`--detail`, `--component`.
- Python views for tables (`estimation_format.views`): `tidy(record, vcov=, conf_level=,
  component=, dropped=)`, `glance(record)`, and `parameters_table`/`glance_table` across a
  collection's members (the flat table of spec 11), as plain dicts for polars, pandas or
  great_tables. The same semantics as estrec's views; t tests use a stdlib Student t (within
  2e-12 of scipy at any df).
- Disclosure levels (spec 4.9; proposal `docs/proposals/disclosure.md`, Ted 2026-11-05):
  how much a record discloses is the sharer's choice, from 1 (estimates, SEs, p-values,
  intervals, N, df) to 5 (environment, execution, agent, every software component). The core
  schema marks each field with `x-level` (`x-level-if` for software components by role);
  `meta.disclosure.level` declares it. Writers default to 4: language, estimator and writer
  only (the writer also in `history[*].by` and `meta.producer`, so its version can be traced),
  no environment, execution, agent or data locations. At
  level 1 `created` may be a date. Validators: fields above the declared level are errors, and
  withheld expected members are information, not warnings. New history action `reduced`.
- Collections: disclosure levels (spec 11.7). `meta.disclosure` and `meta.parent`; the
  collection schema marks its own fields (session times and clients, and events about workers
  and clients, at 5; `session`, `events`, `provenance` and `extensions` at 4); every member
  must be at the collection's level or below; a session or replication collection needs 4 or
  more. `new_collection(level=)` lowers members above it (new records; event references
  follow) and cuts the collection's own fields; it declares nothing by default, so building a
  collection from existing records leaves them as they are. `reduce_collection()`; `estimation
  reduce` takes collections; the validator checks the collection's level. estrec:
  `write_collection(level =)`, default 4 for fits.
- Any field marked `x-identifying` is level 5, so profiles' identifying fields need no mark of
  their own. `dfeols/0.1`: the `dask` block, the time estimate and per-round timings are
  level 5.
- estrec: `to_estimation(level =, purpose =, program =, data_info =)`. Level 4 by default
  (R, fixest and estrec only; no other packages, environment, user, host or command line);
  the marks come from `inst/levels.json`, written by `estimation levels` and kept equal to the
  schema by the Python tests. Profile claims the level breaks are dropped with a
  `profile_not_claimed` message; `add_test()` respects the declared level; the data input is
  named after the call's `data` argument.
- Converters: `level` in the fixest (R) and reghdfe (Stata) converters, default 4; each
  converter names itself as the writer; pyfixest takes `program=` and `data_info=`. The fixest
  converter wrote non-finite numbers as `"Infinity"`; now `"Inf"`, as the format says.
- CLI: `estimation levels` (the marks as JSON, for writers in other languages), `estimation
  reduce FILE --level N -o OUT`, `estimation digest --write FILE`.
- Core: `provenance.execution.session` is level 4 (the rest of `execution` stays 5), so
  session collections work at the default level; a test's `vcov.cluster` is level 3; objects
  and lists that removing fields leaves empty are removed too.
- Purpose profiles: a third catalog `kind`, `purpose`, for what a destination needs, with
  `x-min-level`; a floor where the level is a ceiling.
- Profiles: `dcas/0.1`, the first purpose profile (`spec/profiles/dcas.md`; proposal
  `docs/proposals/aea-profile.md`): results in a replication package for a journal that
  follows the Data and Code Availability Standard (DCAS 1.0: the AEA journals, Econometrica,
  the Economic Journal, the JPE, the JEEA, the Review of Economic Studies and others), from the
  standard and the SSDE README template, at level 4. Example `dcas.estimation.json`. Drafted
  as `aea/0.1` and renamed before release.
- Core: `specification.program` (`{path, line, sha256}`), the program in the replication
  package that ran the command, not identifying. A software `lock` is level 4 without its
  `path` (5). A field's level is never below its parent's.
- Validator and tools: `prepare` and `write` take `level` and `purpose`, drop the claims of
  model profiles the level breaks (`profile_not_claimed` in `meta.messages`) and fail when a
  purpose can't be met; `reduce(record, level)` writes a lowered copy as a new record with
  `meta.parent`; `fields_above`, `record_level`, `level_marks`, `path_level`,
  `DEFAULT_LEVEL_MARKS`. `add_test` and `redact` respect the declared level.
- Collections: `estimation-collection/0.1` (spec section 11, `schema/estimation-collection-0.1.json`,
  catalog entry `collection`), a set of records plus what is true of the set. `meta.kind` is
  `paper`, `session`, `replication`, `batch` or `other` and sets what a validator expects: a
  paper's members with locators and the citation; a session's `session` block (its id on every
  member's `provenance.execution.session`) and `events`; a replication's `events` and
  `publication`. Members are the records themselves, embedded or (above 16 MB) in a JSON Lines
  members file beside the collection; each has the record's `meta.id`, an optional `sha256` of
  its RFC 8785 canonical JSON, a `label` and the collection's own `locator`/`locators`, which
  must match the record's publication locators where it has them. Events are
  `{when, type, member, detail, message}` with an open `type` vocabulary. Size limits apply to
  the file and to the collection without its records; each member is checked as a record.
  Redaction covers the collection and its members. Examples: a paper, a session and a
  replication with a members file.
- Validator and tools: `new_collection`, `write_collection`, `read_collection`,
  `validate_collection` (each member validated as a record, under `members[<i>].record`),
  `redact_collection`, `member_sha256`, `add_event`, `iter_members`; `estimation validate`,
  `redact` and `digest` take collections.
- estrec: `write_collection()` (embedded or JSON Lines members; member hashes with the optional
  `openssl` package) and `to_estimation()` for a plain list of fits, which flattens
  `fixest_multi` elements. RFC 8785 canonical JSON in R, checked against the Python reference.
- estrec: fixest `feglm` and `fepois` fits, as `glm/0.1` and `inference/0.1` records: family
  and link, offset, deviance, McFadden pseudo R², AIC/BIC, dispersion, convergence, z tests
  without `df_t`, and fixest's perfect-fit removals split into `singletons` and `separated`
  (checked against the rows fixest kept). `fenegbin` and `femlm` still fail with a clear error.
- Profiles: `ppmlhdfe/0.1` uses `glm/0.1`'s names for the fixed-effect solver inside each IRLS
  step, as fixest `fepois` records do: `itolerance()` is `options.fixef_tolerance` (was
  `inner_tolerance`) and `e(ic2)` is `structures.numerics.fixef_iterations` (was
  `inner_iterations`).
- estrec: `meta.core_digest` on every record when `openssl` is installed (`digest = FALSE` to
  leave it out), equal to the Python reference's. Software purls follow each package's origin
  (`pkg:cran`, `pkg:github/...@<commit>#<subdir>` from remotes/pak metadata, else
  `pkg:generic`); estrec no longer claims to come from CRAN.

- Core: an optional top-level `tests` list (spec 4.8, `$defs/test`) for every hypothesis test
  about the model: the estimator's own, those asked for after the fit, and linear
  combinations. Each test has a `name`, a `statistic` or `p_value`, and optionally a
  `category`, `origin` (`estimation` or `postestimation`), the hypothesis (`text`, `terms`, and
  `R`, `q` for a linear test), the reference distribution and df, the vcov it used, and its
  `source`. `tests` is append-only: any tool may add tests to a record without writing a new
  one. It is outside the core digest. Profiles name tests by `category` and can expect one
  (`x-expected-tests`).
- Profiles: tests move from their own locations to `tests`: iv (`structures.first_stage` keeps
  only the R²s), linear-fe (`metrics.f_stat`, `f_stat_robust`, `f_fe`), glm and
  conditional-logit (`metrics.chi2`, `chi2_type`), did and csdid (`pretrend`), survival
  (`metrics.lr_test`, `structures.ph_test`), meta-analysis (Egger, Begg), sem (`chisq`,
  `chisq_baseline` and their df and p), mixed (`lr_vs_fixed`), causal-ml (grf calibration).
  `multiple-testing/0.1` accepts `p_value_adjusted` on tests. fixest's `kpr` is mapped to
  the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F (weak identification), valid only with a non-iid vcov and exact
  identification (checked against ivreg2).
- Validator: checks test ids, restriction shapes, and term and vcov references; warns on a
  missing expected test category. `estimation_format.add_test()` appends a test and logs it in
  `history`.

- Core: optional `parameters[*].scale` (`estimation`, `exponentiated`) and `measure`
  (`odds_ratio`, `hazard_ratio`, ...), so exponentiated estimates are labeled.
- Draft profiles for difference-in-differences: `did/0.1` (standard; csdid, R did, did2s,
  pyfixest did2s), and the tool profiles `did2s/0.1` and `csdid/0.1`, with example records
  and pages in `spec/profiles/`.
- Draft profiles for generalized linear models: `glm/0.1` (standard; Stata logit/probit/
  poisson/glm, ppmlhdfe, R glm, fixest feglm/fepois, statsmodels, pyfixest) and the tool
  profile `ppmlhdfe/0.1`, with example records and pages in `spec/profiles/`.
- Draft standard profile `conditional-logit/0.1` (Stata clogit and xtlogit fe,
  survival::clogit, statsmodels ConditionalLogit), with an example record and a page.
- Draft standard profile `mixed/0.1` (lme4, lmerTest, glmmTMB, Stata mixed and me*,
  statsmodels MixedLM, MixedModels.jl), with an example record and a page.
- Draft standard profile `choice/0.1` (mlogit, logitr, apollo, xlogit, Biogeme, Stata cm*
  and mixlogit), with MNL and mixed-logit example records and a page.
- Draft standard profiles `sem/0.1` (lavaan, semopy, Stata sem) and `mediation/0.1` (R
  mediation, lavaan :=, PROCESS, Stata estat teffects, pingouin, statsmodels Mediation),
  with example records and pages.
- Draft cross-cutting standard profiles `mi/0.1`, `survey/0.1`, `multiple-testing/0.1` and
  `resampling/0.1`, which combine with a model's own profile, with example records and pages.
- `mediation/0.1`: two-stage (IV) mediation (`instruments`, `instrumented`), the Aroian
  method and controlled direct effects; mappings for `mediate_tsls`, `ivmediate` and StataNow
  `mediate`.
- Draft standard profile `survival/0.1` (R survival and cmprsk, lifelines, scikit-survival,
  statsmodels PHReg, Stata stcox/streg/stcrreg), with Efron and Breslow Cox examples and a page.
- `mediation/0.1`: several predictors, `total_indirect`, and a mapping for `indirect_boot`.
- Draft tool profile `med2s/0.1` (two-stage DiD mediation), with an `extensions.med2s` block,
  a shape example and a page.
- Draft standard profile `meta-analysis/0.1` (metafor, meta, statsmodels, Stata meta), with an
  example record and a page.
- Draft standard profiles `predictive/0.1` (scikit-learn, XGBoost, ranger, tidymodels, mlr3)
  and `causal-ml/0.1` (DoubleML, EconML, grf), with example records and pages.
- Draft standard profiles `gam/0.1` (mgcv, pyGAM, statsmodels GLMGam) and `bayesian/0.1` (brms,
  rstanarm, Stan, PyMC/ArviZ, Stata bayes), with example records and pages.
- `mediation/0.1`: StataNow `mediate` and `ivmediate` mapped from their help files (pure
  indirect, total direct and potential-outcome-mean effects; interaction and treatment type;
  `ivmediate`'s two first-stage F statistics).
- Stata mappings checked against the help files for `glm`, `clogit`, `cmclogit`,
  `cmmixlogit`, `cmmprobit`, `mixed`, `stcox`, `streg` and `bayes`. `choice/0.1`: Stata stores
  the base alternative as `e(i_base)` (`cmmixlogit`: `e(base)`), not `e(basealt)`, and the
  integration defaults (Hammersley points, a sample-size-dependent count) are now mapped.
  `mixed/0.1`: `e(N_g)` and `e(g_*)` are matrices by level. `survival/0.1`: `streg`'s
  ancillary parameters and `e(frm2)`, and `stcox`/`streg` `e(cmd)` vs `e(cmd2)`.
- Second help-file pass (`logit`, `melogit`, `meglm`, `mi estimate`, `svy`, `svyset`, `sem`,
  `estat gof`, `bootstrap`, `meta summarize`, `stcrreg`, `stcox` postestimation, `bayesmh`,
  `bayesstats grubin`): `mi/0.1` maps RVI to `e(rvi_mi)`, not `e(riv_mi)`; Stata `bootstrap`
  seeds with `rseed()`; `estat phtest` per-term results are the `r(phtest)` matrix; `stcrreg` has no `ties()` option and always reports robust SEs; added
  `bayesmh` and `meta summarize` stored results. Documentation-only R mappings checked against
  source on GitHub (base R `glm` and `p.adjust`, rstanarm/rstan, cmprsk, ri2, caret, tidymodels,
  mlr3): rstanarm has no pathfinder, its `adapt_delta` default is 0.95, and caret's
  `trainControl()` defaults to 25 bootstrap resamples.
- Format `estimation/0.1` (draft) and the `inference/0.1`, `linear-fe/0.1`, `iv/0.1` and
  `dfeols/0.1` profiles, moved from the dfeols repository
  (https://github.com/jemather/dfeols, `src/dfeols/schema/` at a33a767) into their own
  repository. Schema `$id`s now point to `https://estimation-format.github.io/estimation/schema/`.
- `estimation-format` 0.1.0.dev0: the reference validator, writer and redactor, from
  `dfeols.estimation`. The built-in fallback checks cover the standard profiles only; tool
  profiles are checked through their schemas.
- `converters/`: worked converters from pyfixest, fixest (R) and reghdfe (Stata) to
  `linear-fe/0.1` records, with `tests/test_converters.py` comparing the tools on one panel.
- `linear-fe/0.1` (draft): `sigma` defined as sqrt(RSS / (N - K)), with pyfixest `_rmse`
  (sqrt(RSS / N)) recorded as `{value, definition}`; pyfixest has no residual df (`_dfd` is
  the Wald denominator df); reghdfe per-cluster counts are `e(N_clust#)`.
- `linear-fe/0.1` (draft): `metrics.n_singletons` is expected, not required (pyfixest and
  fixest don't store it). The validator now warns for a missing `x-expected` field of a
  claimed profile (also `iv/0.1` `structures.first_stage`); `expected_paths()` lists them.
- `write`/`prepare`: `redact_identifying` also takes a list of paths, so a tool can redact its
  own extension's fields whatever profiles the record claims.
