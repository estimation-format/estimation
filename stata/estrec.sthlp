{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:estrec write} reads the results in {cmd:e()} and writes them as an
{it:estimation record}: a small JSON file with the estimates, standard errors and
p-values, the variance matrix and the small-sample correction behind it, the number of
observations and why rows were dropped, the model's tests, and the software that ran it.
Records written by Stata, R and Python can be compared side by side, so you can see why two
runs differ without rerunning either. Run it right after the estimation command.

{pstd}
The record claims the profiles of the format that fit the command:

{p2colset 9 36 38 2}{...}
{p2col:{cmd:regress}}inference{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:areg}, {cmd:xtreg, fe}, {cmd:reghdfe}}inference, linear-fe{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:xtreg, re}}inference{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:ivregress}, {cmd:ivreg2}}inference, iv{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:ivreghdfe}}inference, iv, linear-fe{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:logit}, {cmd:logistic}, {cmd:probit}, {cmd:poisson}, {cmd:nbreg}}inference, glm{p_end}
{p2col:{cmd:glm}}inference, glm ({cmd:glm, irls}: inference only){p_end}
{p2colreset}{...}

{pstd}
Any other e-class command that posts {cmd:e(b)} and {cmd:e(V)} gets a record with the core
fields only. Results from prefixes ({cmd:svy:}, {cmd:mi estimate:}, {cmd:bootstrap:}, ...)
aren't supported yet.

{pstd}
Estimates are always on the estimation scale, as in {cmd:e(b)}: log-odds after
{cmd:logistic}, not the odds ratios it displays.


{title:Disclosure levels}

{pstd}
{opt level(1)} holds only the estimates, standard errors, p-values, intervals, N and df.
Level 2 adds the other statistics, the variance matrix and the tests; 3 the specification,
clusters and fixed-effect counts; 4 (the default) Stata, the estimation command and
{cmd:estrec} with their versions and the data's size and checksum; 5 the environment, the
data file's path, user and host.


{title:Examples}

{phang2}{cmd:. sysuse auto}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. regress price mpg weight, vce(robust)}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. estrec write using "price.estrec.json", replace}{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. ivregress 2sls price weight (mpg = length turn)}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. estrec write using "iv.estrec.json", replace level(1)}{p_end}

{pstd}
To view records, open them in the record viewer at
{browse "https://estrec.org/viewer/"}
(files are read in the browser, not uploaded), or use the Python tool:
{cmd:estrec show price.estrec.json}.


{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The record has no core digest (optional in the format), since computing it needs
canonical JSON; {cmd:estrec digest --write} {it:filename} adds it.
{cmd:estrec write} reads the UTC time from the operating system with {helpb shell}.
